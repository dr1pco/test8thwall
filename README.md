# Pitch, Play, and Win with AR NFTs!

## Project Overview
Unleash your inner baseball player with our immersive AR mini-game. As you pitch and strike out the player, not only do you relish in the joy of winning, but you also get rewarded with a tangible digital token— a minted NFT ticket through the tiplink wallet. PitchAR exemplifies the cutting edge fusion of web2 and web3 functionality. Through a familiar interface and real-world interactions, we're bridging the gap between digital and physical, offering a seamless transition and engagement model for all kinds of users and businesses.

## Core Features

### Interoperability
- Seamlessly load this mini-game into any digital AR NFT vending machine as a gating mechanism or use it independently.
- Enable people to claim rewards using just their Gmail or existing Solana wallets using a Tiplink wallet.

### Enhanced Engagement
Perfect for businesses looking to showcase their offerings in an interactive manner, enticing potential customers and re-engaging the existing ones. PitchAR provides a truly ideal combination of the digital and physical worlds.

## Key Benefits

### Boost IRL Event Engagement
- Elevate the experience at physical events with augmented reality interactions.

### Securely Reward Loyalty at Scale
- Express gratitude to your faithful customers with minted NFTs that cost you next to nothing (particularly if you use cNFTs) yet are secured by the blockchain.

### Reduce New Customer Churn
- Keep your new clientele engaged with the ability to rotate rewards and digital experiences, ensuring they come back for more.

### Smooth Onboarding
- Transition web2 individuals into the web3 ecosystem with familiar real-life activities.

## Roadmap
- Enhance UI and gameplay dynamics.
- Introduce extended gameplay features, such as a 3-out rule and multiple innings.
- Geofence the game, making it location-specific to business or events.
- Implement support for Tamperproof NFTs allowing businesses to seal codes in their NFT rewards.
- Integrate into digital NFT vending machines offering a gating game template for any business to use and allowing no code creation of engaging customized reward experiences for local businesses from coupons to in-game assets, the digital rewards are limitless.
- Open up PitchAR game development, maintenance, and tournament creation to the community allowing for long term engagement and multiple games/seasons that can run in conjunction with events/the sports season.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
